# Youtube-playlist-downloader
a script that will *probably* scrape a YouTube playlist and download every video in that playlist in mp3 or mp4



run nguvaicalon.exe

paste your playlist's URL

and you should get a list of links that lead to each and every video in that playlist

--that all this script does for now--
